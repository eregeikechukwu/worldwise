 Make sure you review the app.js file and the routing structure.  And you can see we are yusnig the url format that we uised to see everyehere, whereby the url just ciontains the deatails of what is to be disaplyed. Better said, tye ui is stored on the url. The slide is on my phone solater you study it. And one more thing. when we are using the <Link> tag, and probably we want to perform the routing and changing the url by ading something to the end, you dont add the the slash /id to the id, cause that means root url.
Then routing using querystring. We use it this way, in that <Link> tag were we defined the to= path, this time to add a query string we use  a "?" eg: to={`${id}?lat=${position.lat}&lng=${position.lng}`}.
